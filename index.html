            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Lata Mangeshkar, also known as the 'Nightingale of India', was one of the most versatile singers in the
                Indian film industry. Lata was born on September 28, 1929, to classical singer and theatre artist Pandit
                Deenanath Mangeshkar and Shevanti in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Her father started teaching her music at an
                early age. By the time she was five, Lata was seen participating as an actress in plays written by her
                father. Her siblings - Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath - are all accomplished singers and musicians.
                <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a career spanning nearly
                eight decades, Lata Mangeshkar was the singing voice for a bevy of Bollywood leading ladies. She lent
                her voice to over 5,000 songs in over a thousand Hindi and 36 regional films. She had an unprecedented
                impact on Indian film music. Since 1942, Lata pushed back the boundaries of music with her mind-boggling
                skills. Over the years, Lata had sung for actresses from Madhubala to Priyanka Chopra. Best known for
                her versatile voice quality, she recorded albums of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc).
                Lata Mangeshkar passed away on February 6, 2022.
